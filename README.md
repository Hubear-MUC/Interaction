Version history:
----------------

Version 2.0

The code was written completely new.
With this version the program not just outputs a message, but also asks a value from the user.
Thus this time the program does the first real user interaction because also input of data is processed.


Version 1.4

Code redesign to make it readable and maintainable more clearly.
The function is the same as in version 1.3


Version 1.3

Added the line break in the output on the terminal.
So now the "C" won't hide before the prompt anymore and will be visible more clearly.
This will improve the user interaction a lot.


Version 1.2

Code redesign to make it more comfortable to read and maintain.
The function is the same as in version 1.0


Version 1.1

Code redesign to make it more comfortable to read and maintain.
