Interaction 1.3

The first real user interaction made by a program of this coding skill- regaining project.

The program gives out a 

  C
  
on the terminal when invoked by command line.

The "C" was chosen because the program was written in C.

Unfortunately there was no space for the new line- character anymore, so watch carefully at the terminal, especially on the prompt after terminating the program, where the "C" probably hides then.


Version history:
----------------

Version 1.3

Added the line break in the output on the terminal.
So now the "C" won't hide before the prompt anymore and will be visible more clearly.
This will improve the user interaction a lot.


Version 1.2

Code redesign to make it more comfortable to read and maintain.
The function is the same as in version 1.0
